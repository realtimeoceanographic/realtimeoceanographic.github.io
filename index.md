## About

<img src="/assets/img/brandmark.png" alt="RTO" align="left" style="display:none">

Real-Time Oceanographic LLC provides consulting, expert insights, analyses, experimental design services, and marine instrumentation in support of a broad range of oceanographic investigations. We are sea-going scientists and engineers who have worked in some of the harshest environments on Earth. We build instrumentation that survives and deliver knowledge on top of the data we collect. Our company specializes in:

  - Real-time oceanographic observation systems
  - Hydroacoustic monitoring and analysis
  - Acoustic source modeling
  - Environmental impact assesments
  - Seafloor imaging systems and large-scale image analysis problems using machine learning
  - Ultra-deep oceanographic instrumentation design and development
  - Novel UAV and AUV design and development
  - Expert witness testimony in the fields of hydroacoustics, oceanography, geophysics, and cryospheric science.


## People

### Tim Crone, PhD<br><sup>*Founder and Chief Executive Officer*</sup>

<img src="/assets/img/tim.jpg" alt="Tim Crone" align="left" style="margin: 5px 15px 0px 0px" width="130">Tim has over 20 years of experience designing, building, deploying, recovering, and analyzing data from audio and video instrumentation in the very deep ocean. He has a strong track record of building instruments that work, survive at depth, and return the data they are intended to return from these challenging environments. He has deployed and recovered many dozens of instruments that have performed as expected over the decades, and has been to the bottom of the ocean many times in *DSV Alvin*. Tim works primarily in academic research, has published over twenty scientific publications, and has significant experience as a consultant to industry and to the legal community.

### DelWayne Bohnenstiehl, PhD<br><sup>*Founder and Chief Science Officer*</sup>

<img src="/assets/img/del.jpg" alt="DelWayne Bohnenstiehl" align="left" style="margin: 5px 15px 0px 0px" width="130">Del has over 25 years of experience using active sonars and passive underwater acoustic data to investigate a wide range of geophysical and ecological processes. He has been involved in numerous seafloor mapping expeditions, and has authored dozens of scientific papers examining ocean noise sources within the coastal and deep ocean. Del routinely works with long-term (multi-year) passive acoustic datasets, and has previously investigated annual-to-decadal noise trends throughout the global ocean.

### Nick Frearson<br><sup>*Chief Technology Officer*</sup>
